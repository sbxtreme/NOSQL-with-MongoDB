/****************************************/


Mongo db is a document based NOSQL database.
It uses BSON for storing data in database.
It stores unstructured data in BSON format.
It is not relational database.
It's an opensource database.
The data is stored in the form of collections.
The database is schemaless i.e there is no restriction or predefined columns with datatypes to store specific values.

Mongodb vs RDBMS

1) collections vs tables
2) documents(BSON) vs rows
3) fields vs columns

Structure of Mongodb:

Database--> Collections--> Documents

In order to connect to mongodb following needs to be done.
1) install mongodb
2) set environment path
3) go to cmd and type mongod.exe which is mongodb demon.
4) open another cmd and type mongo.exe to start mongo cmd prompt.
5) instead of mongo cmd prompt we can use studio 3t which gives additional features and from there we can perform different database operations.
6) In the tool create connection and open Intellishell and start writing mongodb commands.
